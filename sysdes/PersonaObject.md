# Persona Object Schema

This section defines the fields for a `Persona` object used to control the behavior, tone, and speaking style of the AI case interviewer. The persona adapts based on the consulting firm listed in the `Lesson`.

## Fields

- `case_interview_company`: *string* — One of `"McKinsey & Company"`, `"Bain & Company"`, `"Boston Consulting Group"`; pulled from the lesson’s `case_company` field to influence persona tone and prompt behavior.
- `interviewer_tone`: *string* — Describes the tone and demeanor of the interviewer (e.g., "neutral and analytical", "warm but formal").
- `greeting_style`: *string* — Describes how the interviewer greets the user (e.g., "direct", "encouraging", "scripted intro with case context").
- `general_persona`: *string* — A promptable description of the interviewer’s behavior, speaking style, and coaching logic. It should include reference to `case_interview_company` and simulate the experience of interviewing at that firm.
